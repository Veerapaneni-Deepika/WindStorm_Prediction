# Windstorm Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution that predicts the likelihood of a windstorm occurring in a given region based on environmental factors such as humidity, pressure, and temperature. The model was trained using a labeled dataset and deployed via a web application.

## Features

- Predicts windstorm occurrence based on real-time user input.
- Supports input features: humidity (%), pressure (hPa), temperature (Â°C).
- Trained a classification model using scikit-learn.
- User-friendly web interface built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
- Supports local deployment for testing and demonstrations.
